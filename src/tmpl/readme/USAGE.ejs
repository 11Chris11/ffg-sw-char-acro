#### Skill Circle ####
Fill in the circle if it is a _career_ skill.

#### Skill Pool ####
* Fill the bottom triangle of the _pool_ box for each rank of a
  characteristic you have for that skill
* Fill in the top part when you get a rank.
* This way you can read it as 'filled', 'filled', 'half' equals
  'proficiency', 'proficiency', 'ability' (or for the color obsessed 'yellow',
  'yellow', 'green').
* _Alternatively_ you can use a slash for ability, and an opposite slash (which
  makes an 'X') to indicate ability/proficiency.

### Development Trees ###

* Put an 'X' in the box if you have purchased that column/row of the tree.
* For powers, and other trees where an ability spans multiple columns, put a
  line through the relevant boxes.
