![FaD Front](./pub/img/aurebesh-fad-front.png);

And now, **form fillable** in [Adobe Reader][reader].

Get the goodies in the [pub](./pub) directory (_form fillable versions have a
'-ff' at the end of the filename_).

I only used form fields.

There is no interactiveness to these.

This was in an effort to make these as wildly useful as possible.

Usage
-----

### Skills ###

![Skills Usage](./pub/img/skill-usage.png)

* Fill in the circle if it is a _career_ skill.
* Fill the bottom triangle of the _pool_ box for each rank of a
  characteristic you have for that skill
* Fill in the top part when you get a rank.
* This way you can read it as 'filled', 'filled', 'half' equals
  'proficiency', 'proficiency', 'ability' (or for the color obsessed 'yellow',
  'yellow', 'green').
* _Alternatively_ you can use a slash for ability, and an opposite slash (which
  makes an 'X') to indicate ability/proficiency.

### Development Trees ###

![Development Tree Usage](./pub/img/development-tree-usage.png)

* Put an 'X' in the box if you have purchased that column/row of the tree.
* For powers, and other trees where an ability spans multiple columns, put a
  line through the relevant boxes.
* Use the _Abilites_ section to actually summarize the individual abilities that
  come from purchasing the talents.
